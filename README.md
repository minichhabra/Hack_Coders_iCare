<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
Cardiotocograms (CTGs) is a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. 
<br>We have performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset which contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetricians into 3 classes:
      Normal, Suspect,  Pathological
      
<h3>Virtual Community</h3>

All women need access to high-quality care in pregnancy, and during and after childbirth. Providing access to adequate healthcare and proper health information is challenging for midwives, nurses, nutritionists, educators working in low-income countries and rural regions.
<br>  Our platform permits live chat with other moms,  establishing a deeper connection than what general social media interaction might enable, staying connected to their gynecologist, and tracking their visible symptoms, <br>vital changes on a daily and weekly basis.
